# Gemini AI API Python Notebook Examples

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks demonstrating how to interact with the Gemini generative AI API using Google Cloud's Vertex AI. These notebooks provide practical examples for various use cases, allowing you to quickly get started with exploring the capabilities of Gemini. The project is based on the official Google Cloud documentation and samples.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
pip install google-auth
pip install ipykernel
```

You will also need:
1.  A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.
2.  Vertex AI API enabled for your GCP project.
3.  Python 3.7 or a later version installed.
4.  Authentication with your Google Cloud account using Application Default Credentials (ADC).

## Usage
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd notebooks
    ```
4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  **Open and run the desired notebook:** Select the notebook you want to explore and execute the cells.

## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:
*   `notebooks/`: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook files.
    *   `gemini_pro_text_generation.ipynb`: A basic example of text generation using the Gemini Pro model.
    *   `gemini_pro_parameter_exploration.ipynb`: A notebook that explores different parameters for text generation.
    *   `gemini_pro_use_cases.ipynb`: A notebook that demonstrates various use cases for the Gemini API.
    *   `generate_readme_doc.ipynb`: A notebook that generates a README.md file from a PDF of a Jupyter Notebook.

The notebooks showcase how to:
*   Set up your environment and configure your Google Cloud project for accessing the Gemini API.
*   Generate text using the Gemini Pro model based on prompts.
*   Experiment with various parameters like temperature, top-p, and max output tokens.
*   Handle different input types.
*   Interpret the API response and extract the generated text.
*   Implement basic use cases such as creative writing, summarization, and question answering.

## Examples
The notebook `generate_readme_doc.ipynb` takes a PDF of a Jupyter Notebook as input and generates a README.md file. The output of this notebook is a markdown file that describes the notebook.
