# Gemini AI API Python Notebook Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks demonstrating how to interact with the Gemini generative AI API using Google Cloud's Vertex AI. These notebooks provide practical examples for various use cases, allowing you to quickly get started with exploring the capabilities of Gemini.

This project is based on the official Google Cloud documentation and samples found here: [https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/samples/generativeaionvertexai-gemini-pro-example](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/samples/generativeaionvertexai-gemini-pro-example)

## Project Overview

The notebooks in this repository showcase how to:

*   **Set up your environment:** Configure your Google Cloud project and authentication for accessing the Gemini API.
*   **Generate text:** Use the Gemini Pro model to generate text based on prompts.
*   **Explore different parameters:** Experiment with various parameters like temperature, top-p, and max output tokens to control the generation process.
*   **Handle different input types:** Learn how to provide text prompts and potentially other input types (depending on the specific notebook).
*   **Understand the API response:** Interpret the API response and extract the generated text.
*   **Implement basic use cases:** Demonstrate practical applications of the Gemini API, such as creative writing, summarization, and question answering.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks, you will need:

1.  **A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project:** If you don't have one, you can create a free account.
2.  **Vertex AI API enabled:** Ensure the Vertex AI API is enabled for your GCP project.
3.  **Python 3.7+:** Make sure you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed.
4.  **Required Python libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
    pip install google-auth
    pip install ipykernel
    ```

5.  **Authentication:** You will need to authenticate with your Google Cloud account. The recommended way is to use Application Default Credentials (ADC). You can set this up by following the instructions in the Google Cloud documentation.

## Notebook Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

*   `notebooks/`: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook files.
    *   `gemini_pro_text_generation.ipynb`: A basic example of text generation using the Gemini Pro model.
    *   `gemini_pro_parameter_exploration.ipynb`: A notebook that explores different parameters for text generation.
    *   `gemini_pro_use_cases.ipynb`: A notebook that demonstrates various use cases for the Gemini API.
    *   `...`: (Add more notebooks as you create them)

## How to Use the Notebooks

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd notebooks
    ```
4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  **Open and run the desired notebook:** Select the notebook you want to explore and execute the cells.
